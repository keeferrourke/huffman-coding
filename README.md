# Huffman Coding
This is a (not yet completed) school project, written in C++ for my grade 12 computer science course, in which I studied the Huffman coding lossless compression algorithm.

### What works
Compression works on most plain text files.

### What doesn't
Decompression is not yet implemented

### What needs to be done
A complete rewrite is planned, as well as finishing the project.
