# Huffman Coding
This is my final grade 12 computer science project, written in C++, in which I studied the Huffman coding lossless compression algorithm.

### What works
Compression works on most plain text files.

### What doesn't
Decompression is not yet implemented

### What needs to be done
A complete rewrite ~~is planned, as well as finishing the project.~~
